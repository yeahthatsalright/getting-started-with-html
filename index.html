    <h>Notes on HTML</h>
<br>
<br><em>-Web Pages-</em></br>
<br>Web pages are designed to give information using a code of <em class="tuna">HTML</em> to make users</br>
able to see and access content by allowing browser to affectively communicate with<br>
servers.<br>
All of this can be found <a href="www.udacity.com"> here</a>.<br>
<br>
<em>-In Line vs. Block Elements-<br>
  <br></em><b>In line</b> lettering are things like "[br]" and "[span] that are used as containers for <b>text</b> <br> associated with HTML text with styling and other features. <br>
<br> <b>Block elements</b> examples would be things like "[p]" and [div] because they are used<br> as a container for in-line elements to alter the visual nature of the web page.<br>
<br> A good reference for this material can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_blocks.asp">at this website</a>.
